title: Lower Limb Compartment Testing
---
body:

      <p class="pb-1">This diagram depicts the four compartments of the lower limb and the associated muscles and nerves within each compartment. During compartment syndrome a compartment becomes compressed, which may result in neurovascular damage. Compartment syndrome is diagnosed by inserting a pressure monitor into the suspected compartment and measuring pressure levels.</p>

      <p class="pb-2">This diagram was created in collaboration with Dr. Mark Hutchinson at the Department of Orthopaedics at the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System.</p>
